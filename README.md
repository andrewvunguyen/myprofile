## INTEREST IN IT

##### What is your interest in IT/ What makes IT interesting for you?

##### When did your interest in IT start?

##### Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?

##### Outline your IT experience (if any)
My experience with Information Technology is limited to the days I spent in high school. My interests back then were on the health sciences, so I was more drawn to Chemistry and Biology. As my goals have changed, so have my interests.

##### Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
The first reason I chose to study with RMIT was because of the flexibility it offered me. Through browsing the different universities that provided logistics and supply chain education, RMIT stood out. The option to study online while staying back in Sydney was attractive. In addition, the university's reputation and rich history of providing education in the field of logistics and supply chain was a bonus. Furthermore, it has strong industry connections.

##### What do you expect to learn during your studies?
During my studies with RMIT, I expect to learn the theoretical aspects necessary to enter the field of logistics and supply chain management. I understand that to gather the knowledge I want, I also have to put in the work in, and that, I am willing to. 
RMIT is a great university with a long history in logistics and supply chain education. Its school of business IT and logistics has been operational for more than 20 years.

##### What do the results of the Learning style test mean for me?
Based on the learning style test, my learning type is visual. This means that I learn visually, and the use of visual aids will work to increase my ability to absorb and retain information. Because I am a visual learner, I will more likely take down notes rather than get involved in discussions.

## PROJECT IDEA 

##### What are you passionate about?

##### What kind of IT innovation would you like to see?

##### What project will help you develop the skills, experience and knowledge required to make you qualified for your ideal job?

### Overview
The project will be a smartphone app called ‘Food Near Me’. Food Near Me is a food app that will bring restauranteurs and users one step closer. The app offers an array of features, such as information and deals from nearby restaurants.

Once the local restaurants are listed, images of the restaurant will act as the thumbnail, as well as to give users an indicative atmosphere. On the app, cuisine type, price range, and the restaurant’s proximity to a user will also be displayed. Users will have access to full menus, as well as make table bookings on the app. 

### Motivation
The motivation behind Food Near Me is its usefulness to diners, in particular, individuals and couples who frequently dine out. The app's usefulness is mainly derived from its features, such as its ability and efficiency in providing users with the necessary information they want of a restaurant.

As these features are unprecedented, individuals in the past have been forced to enter a restaurant to get a feel of the atmosphere and prices and ended up dining there. And so, Food Near Me essentially prevents this and will give users a true image of a restaurant and what to expect before this occurs.

### Description 
‘Food Near Me’ will be an app that incorporates many functions into one package. Its features include locating the user and suggesting nearby restaurants, a filtering option for users to choose between different cuisines, price ranges, and dietary needs. The app will also enable users to review and read reviews on the dishes and restaurants they are assessing. Restaurateurs may also promote their restaurant via the app. And an option to book tables on the app is also available. If the restaurant offers food delivery, the option will also be displayed.

Locating the user and suggesting nearby restaurants will work via GPS and will ask permission from the user beforehand. A list of all the available restaurants near the user will appear, based on a set radius. This radius can be modified to reduce or extend the distance from the user. Each section showing a restaurant will label how far the restaurant is from the user, its price range, cuisine type, and an image of the restaurant will be the thumbnail to show the user the expected atmosphere.  

The option to filter between different cuisines, price ranges and dietary needs is also available. Users may select between cuisines such as Chinese, Mexican, Italian, Japanese, Greek, French, Thai, Spanish or Mediterranean. A restaurant can also be selected based on price ranges, such as $, $$, or $$$. The option for the user to set an upper and lower price limit will also be available. The dietary needs will also be covered, such as the Atkins diet, Ketogenic diet, Vegetarian diet, Vegan diet, and the Mediterranean diet as needed. If a specific option is not available, the app will show the user the friendliest restaurant for their dietary needs, and the best dishes to select. 

Reviewing and reading reviews will also be another feature of the app. Users can review dishes after they have consumed them, based on a 1 to 10 rating. The option to recommend the dish and comment on their thoughts is also possible. Other users can view these ratings and can then decide on whether a restaurant is for them.

Restaurants can also promote certain dishes, or the restaurant itself, via the app. Promotions include a percentage discount on dishes or a buy one get one free scenario can be employed. As users are increasingly seeking free and cheap food, such options will incentivize them to dine at the restaurant. Furthermore, a good track record of satisfied customers will work in favour of the restauranteur. This will ensure that restaurants ensure their food and service is top quality. 

Furthermore, users can book a table via the app, where they may select a day and time slot. The restauranteur will confirm their booking as soon as they receive the request. The user will thereafter receive a message notification on the app to confirm their booking. And lastly, if a restaurant offers food delivery, this option will also be displayed on the restaurant thumbnail and in the details when the user selects the restaurant in the app.

### Tools and technologies 

Firstly, the software component consists of an app programming language, a designing tool, and an emulator. A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer to perform specific tasks. Examples include Java, C, C++, Corona, PhoneGap, Titanium, and HTML 5. 

And an emulator/app testing tool is one that allows a host device to act like a guest device. This enables the host system to run software designed for the guest system. Examples of emulators are the Google Android emulator, the official Android SDK emulator, Mobione, and eggplant. Examples of open source tools include Android (for Android), and XCode (for iOS). 

### Skills required 
The skills necessary for this project include product management skills, design skills, writing skills, QA and performance testing skills, coding skills, cross-platform skills, and data skills. Given my inexperience with information technology, I do not currently possess these skills. 

Although seeking the resources to learn these skills may not be difficult, given the time constraints, they are relatively out of reach. The software component will include emulators, designing tools, and app programming languages. And hardware, excluding a mobile device and computer, may extend further, requiring a sizable amount of capital. Hence, building such an app is not feasible.


### Outcome 
The original problem stemmed from how difficult it was to get information on a restaurant a user wanted unless stepping into a restaurant. This resulted in diners entering mediocre restaurants or decent restaurants but with high expectations and left disappointed. What Food Near Me essentially does is mitigate this. 

It provides the same information a user would get from walking into a restaurant, all from the comfort of their mobile device. On the app, the user will have access to full menus, including images, prices, and ratings. The impact of this is that users will know what to expect when they walk into a restaurant.
